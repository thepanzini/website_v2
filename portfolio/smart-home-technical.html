    <p class="small-style width-n-position">An example of IoT Cloud architecture using AWS</p>
    <p class="text-style width-n-position">
        As the above image may give away, this mobile application was built with Amazon Web Services
        (AWS). The app was a developed as a companion to smart home products (switch & outlet, etc..). Requiring
        features such as account synchronisation, push notifications, constant bi-directional communication (MQTT),
        issuing commands over local TCP/IP, cloud databases, servers, OAuth 2.0 protocol, Google Assistant/Alexa/Samsung
        Smart Things/IFTTT & Nest integration.
    </p>
    <p class="text-style width-n-position">
        I'm responsible for developing whole system from architecture design to
        development, I wore all the hats along the full stack spectrum. Managing and configuring the web & O.Auth 2.0
        servers. Creating database schemas and being full admin of the database for security, health and back up
        procedures. Setting up push notification with the various services like Apple push notification services (APNS)
        and Firebase. Developing the serverless functions required for Google Assistant/Alexa/Samsung Smart
        Things/IFTTT/Nest integration. Making use of the IoT Core, Lambda, API Gateway, and Lightsail services some of
        which are not pictured above.
    </p>
    <p class="text-style width-n-position">
        The application itself was developed using C# on a platform called Xamarin if your
        not familiar, it uses a single C# code base to compile natively to Android & iOS.

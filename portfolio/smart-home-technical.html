            As the above image may give away, this mobile application was built with Amazon Web Services
            (AWS). The app was a developed as a companion to smart home products (switch & outlet, etc..). Requiring
            features such as account synchronisation, push notifications, constant bi-directional communication (MQTT),
            issuing commands over local TCP/IP, cloud databases, servers, OAuth 2.0 protocol, Google
            Assistant/Alexa/Samsung Smart Things/IFTTT & Nest integration. The application itself was developed using C#
            on a platform called Xamarin if your not familiar, it uses a single C# code base to compile natively to
            Android & iOS.
        </p>
        <p class="text-style width-n-position col-50">
            I'm responsible for developing whole system from architecture design to development, I wore all the hats
            along the full stack spectrum. Managing and configuring the web & O.Auth 2.0 servers. Creating database
            schemas and being full admin of the database for security, health and back up procedures. Setting up push
            notification with the various services like Apple push notification services (APNS) and Firebase. Developing
            the serverless functions required for Google Assistant/Alexa/Samsung Smart Things/IFTTT/Nest integration.
            Making use of the IoT Core, Lambda, API Gateway, and Lightsail services some of which are not pictured
            above.

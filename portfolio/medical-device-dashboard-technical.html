        I was responsible for implementing many linux backend services written in python that subscribed to the
        topics
        and manipulated the SQLITE databases to update, insert, delete, or upsert data. One such service was created
        to
        monitor and configure the underlying linux network manager through DBUS. A major service also uses queues,
        and
        multithreading to handle new incoming requests while composing and sending emails that contain HTML template
        bodies translated via gettext to supported languages with attachments in text, pdf or zip form.

        <p class="text-style width-n-position col-50">
            I implemented the 15+ page UI and client side javascript using jQuery and ajax calls including multi
            language
            translations and Charts. I built the web back end in PHP to handle all the front end data submissions
            through
            MQTT. The whole system was designed around using MQTT to send data to services to decouple components.
        </p>
        <p class="text-style width-n-position col-50">
            I opted for NGINX as a lightweight solution for the web server and was responsible for
            configuring the server to use php-fpm to server the php content. Many of the services I implemented I was
            also
            responsible for adding documentation and creating the architecture.

    <p class="text-style width-n-position">
        As the above image may give away, this mobile application was built with Amazon Web Services
        (AWS). The app was a developed as a companion to smart home products (switch & outlet, etc..). Requiring
        features such as account synchronisation, push notifications, constant bi-directional communication (MQTT),
        issuing commands over local TCP/IP, cloud databases, servers, OAuth 2.0 protocol, Google
        Assistant/Alexa/Samsung Smart Things/IFTTT & Nest integration. The application itself was developed using C#
        on a platform called Xamarin if your not familiar, it uses a single C# code base to compile natively to
        Android & iOS. Making use of the IoT Core, Lambda, API Gateway, and Lightsail services some of
        which are not pictured above.
